Are the residential property bands of [3 decades ago](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/understand-how-council-tax-bands-are-assessed#council-tax-bands-in-england-based-on-1-april-1991-values) becoming less so? Would a sample of those recently-sold reveal band convergence? And what may be inferred about those not sampled?

Over the years, urban properties have been added to and divided up. And two streets of equal attractiveness, and with equivalently-banded properties, may have diverged as neighbourhoods evolved.

Whilst properties can and do move to higher or lower bands following alteration, would a sample of those recently-sold reveal band convergence after so long? And what may be inferred about the wider housing stock?
