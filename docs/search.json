And what may be inferred about those not sampled?\nOver the years, urban properties have been added to and divided up. And two streets of equal attractiveness, and with equivalently-banded properties, may have diverged as neighbourhoods evolved.\nWhilst properties can and do move to higher or lower bands following alteration, would a sample of those recently-sold reveal band convergence after so long? And what may be inferred about the wider housing stock?"
