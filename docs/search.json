And two streets of equal attractiveness, and with equivalently-banded properties, may have diverged as neighbourhoods evolved.\nWhilst properties can and do move to higher or lower bands following alteration, would a sample of those recently-sold reveal band convergence after so long? And what may be inferred about the wider housing stock?"

According to a recent report by (synopsys2024ossra) about \\(96\\%\\) of commercial software uses Open Source Software (OSS). Another recent contribution by (hoffmann2024value) estimates the demand-side value of OSS to be \\(8.8\\) trillion USD. Still, economists only have limited understanding of this vital part of the modern digital infrastructure which is also due to the lack of tools to think about OSS. In this report, we focus on geographical aspects of the input output structure observed in five OSS ecosystems. We use tools of the Global Value Chains (GVCs) literature to build global Open-Source-Software-Input-Output (OSSIO) tables based on software dependencies.\nSubject to revision."
