And two streets of equal attractiveness, and with equivalently-banded properties, may have diverged as neighbourhoods evolved.\nWhilst properties can and do move to higher or lower bands following alteration, would a sample of those recently-sold reveal band convergence after so long? And what may be inferred about the wider housing stock?"

It is designed from PhD students for PhD students. All PhD students in the field of economics are warmly invited. We discuss every two to three weeks one of the papers in the most recent issue of Quartely Journal of Economics. The scope of the reading group is intentionally brought to allow us doctoral students a wide understanding of economics instead of focusing narrowly on our own research topics.\nDates will follow shortly."
