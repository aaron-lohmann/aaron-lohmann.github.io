And two streets of equal attractiveness, and with equivalently-banded properties, may have diverged as neighbourhoods evolved.\nWhilst properties can and do move to higher or lower bands following alteration, would a sample of those recently-sold reveal band convergence after so long? And what may be inferred about the wider housing stock?"

Nothing fancy and is something I did as a research assistant some time back but still maybe it is useful to someone."
