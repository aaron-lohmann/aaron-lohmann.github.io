My name is Aaron Lohmann, I am an econ PhD student at IfW Kiel and Bielefeld University. I work on the intersection of trade, innovation and digital technology. Currently, I spend most of my time on data from open source software developers using theoretical models from the trade/growth/production network literature. I care about understanding global collaboration patterns and long run growth in knowledge intensive sectors.
